                <p>Perhaps one of the biggest twists in Naruto is how Tobi turned out to be Obito, Kakashi's friend who fans were led to believe was killed underneath a rock.</p>
                <p>t turns out he paired up with Madara Uchihaーanother ninja fans thought to be dead, but lived off of Hashirama's cellsーto help with the Tsukiyomi plan. Obito was twisted so much by seeing Kakashi supposedly kill Rin with Chidori, despite her willingly walking into his jutsu. His love for Rin ran so deep that it changed into an ugly emotion, which he knows best.</p>

                <p>What most fans are unaware of is how somber and twisted the backstories a lot of Mist Ninja have, as Kisame killed one of the past membersーFuguki Suikazanーand joined the ranks. Kisame did this as he was taught to prioritize the mission over the lives of his comrades. This is where he gained the sentient sword, Samehada, the most terrifying swords out of the Seven Swordsmen's weapons.</p>

During his frequent rages, he killed all but one of his partners in the organisation, due to the latter being immortal. His skills were such that he was chosen by his village to assassinate Hashirama Senju, surviving the battle despite failing the mission. Kakuzu's might is such, that had it not been for the interference of Team Yamato, he would have likely killed Team Asuma..</p>
